# Manage Tags Modal Refactor - Progress Log

## Feature Overview
Refactor "Manage Tags" from a full-screen view to a compact modal within the folder context. The modal opens from the tag button in the input area, featuring inline tag editing (click to edit), color picker dropdown, and two-step delete pattern.

## Design Decisions
- Modal style: Compact popover-style (~300px wide, max ~350px height)
- Trigger: Tag button in input area opens modal (instead of view navigation)
- Tag editing: Click tag name for inline edit (no nested modal)
- Color editing: Click color dot for dropdown picker (8 colors in 2x4 grid)
- Delete: Two-step pattern (first click shows checkmark, second confirms)
- Layout: "TAGS" section label instead of border separator
- Empty state: "No tags yet" centered muted text
