## Notes
- Design document: docs/plans/2026-01-17-quickclip-settings-design.md
- Use frontend-design skill for UI tasks
- Reuse existing components: SettingsSection, SettingsRow, hotkey recorder

## 2026-01-17 - Task 1: Create settings view component with navigation
- What was implemented:
  - Created QuickClipSettings.tsx with full settings UI structure
  - Added SettingsSection, SettingsRow, and SegmentedToggle components (following global Settings pattern)
  - Integrated Checkbox from shadcn/ui for audio settings
  - Reused ShortcutCapture component from core/components/Settings
  - Added gear icon button to QuickClip header (both recordings view and onboarding view)
  - Implemented view state toggling between 'recordings' and 'settings'
  - Set up breadcrumb navigation with back-navigation support via onNavigate callback
  - Updated types.ts: Added 'area' to CaptureMode, added 'resolution' field to QuickClipSettings
  - Settings gear is disabled while recording/encoding is in progress
- Files changed:
  - src/plugins/quickclip/QuickClipSettings.tsx (new)
  - src/plugins/quickclip/QuickClipPlugin.tsx (modified)
  - src/plugins/quickclip/types.ts (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Navigation levels should be conditionally registered based on current view - the settings view manages its own breadcrumb with onNavigate callback
  - SettingsSection and SettingsRow are local to Settings.tsx, not shared - replicated pattern in QuickClipSettings
  - ShortcutCapture is reusable from core/components/Settings
  - Checkbox component needs custom border classes to match dark theme aesthetic
