## Notes
- Tasks 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17 should use the frontend-design skill
- No borders between sections, use headers as separators
- Neon border animation: white/gray gradient rotating around border
- Server starts lazily when entering Tasks plugin
- Each subtask execution creates a new opencode session
- AI edits JSON directly, path passed in prompt
- Learnings from all previous executions included in prompt

## Design Decisions Summary
- Task = PRD (name, description, workingDirectory, subtasks)
- Subtask = PRD item (steps, category, shouldCommit, notes, executionLogs)
- Expand subtask with animation to see all details
- Run/Stop per subtask, Run All for loop
- One execution at a time, others disabled
- History: inline in subtask + aggregated section at bottom
- OpenCode Server API on port 4096
- Migration: automatic, preserves old data

## 2026-01-21 15:17 - Task 1: Backend - Update data model types

### What was implemented
- Added `TaskStatus` enum (waiting, in_progress, completed) for subtask status
- Added `SubtaskCategory` enum (functional, test) for categorizing subtasks
- Added `ExecutionOutcome` enum (success, partial, failed, aborted) for execution results
- Created `Step` struct (id, text, completed) for subtask checklist items
- Created `Learnings` struct with patterns/gotchas/context vectors
- Created `ExecutionLog` struct with all fields (id, startedAt, completedAt, duration, outcome, summary, filesChanged, learnings, committed, commitHash, commitMessage, errorMessage)
- Updated `Subtask` struct with new fields: status, order, category, steps, shouldCommit, notes, executionLogs
- Added legacy fields (completed, position) as Option with skip_serializing for migration compatibility
- Updated `Task` struct with description and workingDirectory fields
- Updated `TaskWithTags` response struct to include new Task fields
- Fixed all usages in commands.rs: subtasks_create, subtasks_toggle, subtasks_reorder, tasks_update_status cascade
- Fixed SQLite migration in storage.rs to include new Task fields

### Files changed
- `src-tauri/src/plugins/tasks/types.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/plugins/tasks/commands.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/plugins/tasks/storage.rs`

### Learnings for future iterations
- **Patterns discovered:**
  - All types use `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` for JS interop
  - Use `#[serde(default)]` for new fields to maintain backward compatibility
  - Use `#[serde(skip_serializing)]` for deprecated fields that should be read but not written
  - Enums use `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]` for serialization
- **Gotchas encountered:**
  - When changing a field type (e.g., bool → enum), need to update all usages in commands.rs
  - SQLite migration also constructs Task manually, needs updating when Task fields change
  - TaskWithTags is a separate response struct that duplicates Task fields - must update both
- **Useful context:**
  - Subtask creation is in `subtasks_create` command at line ~384
  - Subtask toggle (now status change) is in `subtasks_toggle` command at line ~423
  - Task cascade (mark all subtasks complete) is in `tasks_update_status` command at line ~210
