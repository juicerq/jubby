# Manage Tags Modal Refactor - Progress Log

## Feature Overview
Refactor "Manage Tags" from a full-screen view to a compact modal within the folder context. The modal opens from the tag button in the input area, featuring inline tag editing (click to edit), color picker dropdown, and two-step delete pattern.

## Design Decisions
- Modal style: Compact popover-style (~300px wide, max ~350px height)
- Trigger: Tag button in input area opens modal (instead of view navigation)
- Tag editing: Click tag name for inline edit (no nested modal)
- Color editing: Click color dot for dropdown picker (8 colors in 2x4 grid)
- Delete: Two-step pattern (first click shows checkmark, second confirms)
- Layout: "TAGS" section label instead of border separator
- Empty state: "No tags yet" centered muted text

## 2026-01-16 - Task 1: Remove 'tags' view from navigation system
- What was implemented:
  - Removed 'tags' from TodoView type (now only 'folders' | 'list')
  - Removed tags view case from header configuration
  - Removed tags view case from main render switch
  - Changed tag button to no-op (will be wired to modal in Task 6)
  - Cleaned up unused components/functions that were orphaned:
    - Removed handleCreateTag, handleEditTag, handleDeleteTag handlers (will be recreated in Task 6)
    - Removed createTag, updateTag, deleteTag from destructured storage (will be re-added in Task 6)
    - Removed TodoPluginTagManager, TodoPluginTagManagerList, TodoPluginTagCard, TodoPluginTagEditModal
    - Removed TodoPluginCreateTagRow, TodoPluginColorPicker, TodoPluginInlineColorPicker
    - Exported TAG_COLORS for future use in color picker components
- Files changed:
  - src/plugins/todo/TodoPlugin.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript's noUnusedLocals flag catches orphaned code during refactors - good for incremental cleanup
  - Exporting constants that will be reused (TAG_COLORS) is a clean way to keep them during transitions
  - Removing components that will be recreated is cleaner than suppressing warnings during transitional states
