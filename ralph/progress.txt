## Codebase Patterns
- Use bun as the package manager
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Project uses Tauri v2 with React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 uses Vite plugin instead of PostCSS config
- shadcn/ui components are in src/components/ui/
- Path alias @/ maps to ./src/ (configured in tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts)
- Dark theme is set via class="dark" on HTML element
- System tray logic is in src-tauri/src/tray.rs (setup_tray + handle_run_event)
- To keep app in background on close: intercept CloseRequested event and call api.prevent_close()
- Tauri Position/Size are enums (Physical/Logical variants) - pattern match to extract values
- Window configuration goes in tauri.conf.json app.windows array
- Plugin data storage in src-tauri/src/storage.rs: read_plugin_data/write_plugin_data commands save to ~/.local/share/jubby/{plugin_id}.json
- Use usePluginStorage<T>(pluginId, defaultValue) hook for plugin persistence - returns { data, setData, isLoading }

## 2026-01-12 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Initialized Tauri v2 project with React + TypeScript template
  - Configured TypeScript with strict mode (already enabled by default)
  - Renamed project from tauri-init to jubby in Cargo.toml, main.rs, and tauri.conf.json
  - Set up bun and installed dependencies
  - Verified cargo build and bun tsc --noEmit pass
- Files changed:
  - Created all project files from Tauri template
  - Modified: src-tauri/Cargo.toml (renamed package)
  - Modified: src-tauri/src/main.rs (updated lib reference)
  - Modified: src-tauri/tauri.conf.json (updated productName, identifier, title)
  - Modified: .gitignore (added Tauri, Claude Code, and Ralph patterns)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The Tauri template creates a .git folder inside src-tauri that needs to be removed when using a parent git repo
  - bun tauri dev first run downloads and compiles ~500 Rust crates, which takes several minutes
  - TypeScript strict mode is enabled by default in the React + TypeScript template
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Installed Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
  - Initialized shadcn/ui with zinc color scheme
  - Set dark theme as default by adding class="dark" to HTML element
  - Added Button component from shadcn/ui
  - Configured path aliases (@/) in both tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts
  - Updated App.tsx to use Tailwind classes and shadcn Button
  - Removed old App.css in favor of Tailwind-based styling
- Files changed:
  - Modified: index.html (added dark class, updated title)
  - Modified: package.json (added tailwindcss, shadcn dependencies)
  - Modified: vite.config.ts (added tailwind plugin, path alias)
  - Modified: tsconfig.json (added path aliases)
  - Created: src/index.css (Tailwind and shadcn CSS variables)
  - Created: src/components/ui/button.tsx (shadcn Button)
  - Created: src/lib/utils.ts (cn utility function)
  - Created: components.json (shadcn config)
  - Modified: src/App.tsx (use Tailwind classes, shadcn Button)
  - Modified: src/main.tsx (import index.css)
  - Deleted: src/App.css
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind CSS v4 uses @tailwindcss/vite plugin instead of PostCSS configuration
  - shadcn init --defaults uses New York style and zinc colors automatically
  - The cn() utility from src/lib/utils.ts is essential for merging Tailwind classes
  - Dark theme requires class="dark" on HTML element (not body)
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-003
- What was implemented:
  - Created src/core/ folder with subfolders: components/, hooks/, context/
  - Created src/plugins/ folder with registry.ts (typed plugin array)
  - Created src/shared/ folder with subfolders: components/, lib/
  - Created src/core/types.ts with PluginManifest interface
  - Added .gitkeep files to preserve empty directories in git
- Files changed:
  - Created: src/core/types.ts (PluginManifest interface)
  - Created: src/plugins/registry.ts (empty plugins array)
  - Created: src/core/components/.gitkeep
  - Created: src/core/hooks/.gitkeep
  - Created: src/core/context/.gitkeep
  - Created: src/shared/components/.gitkeep
  - Created: src/shared/lib/.gitkeep
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use .gitkeep files to preserve empty folders in git
  - PluginManifest interface uses ComponentType from React for the component field
  - The @/ path alias works correctly for imports between new folders
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-004
- What was implemented:
  - Added tray-icon and image-png features to Tauri in Cargo.toml
  - Created src-tauri/src/tray.rs with system tray logic
  - System tray icon appears when app starts (uses default window icon)
  - Clicking tray icon toggles window visibility (show/hide)
  - Closing window hides it instead of exiting (app runs in background)
  - Updated lib.rs to use tray module with setup and run event handlers
- Files changed:
  - Modified: src-tauri/Cargo.toml (added tray-icon, image-png features)
  - Modified: src-tauri/Cargo.lock (new dependencies)
  - Created: src-tauri/src/tray.rs (tray setup and event handlers)
  - Modified: src-tauri/src/lib.rs (added tray module, setup, run handler)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tauri v2 requires `tray-icon` feature in Cargo.toml for system tray
  - Use `image-png` feature to enable Image::from_bytes for PNG icons
  - Use app.default_window_icon() to get icon from tauri.conf.json bundle
  - To keep app running in background: intercept WindowEvent::CloseRequested and call api.prevent_close()
  - Use .build() instead of .run() when you need to handle custom run events
  - The window label "main" is the default for the first window in tauri.conf.json
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-005
- What was implemented:
  - Configured window as popover (400x350px, no decorations, starts hidden)
  - Window positioned near tray icon when clicked (centered horizontally)
  - Smart positioning: shows below tray if at top, above if at bottom
  - Toggle behavior: click to show, click again to hide
  - Window always on top and skipped from taskbar
- Files changed:
  - Modified: src-tauri/tauri.conf.json (window config: size, decorations, visible, skipTaskbar, alwaysOnTop)
  - Modified: src-tauri/src/tray.rs (added positioning logic using TrayIconEvent.rect)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tauri v2 Position and Size are enums with Physical/Logical variants - must pattern match
  - TrayIconEvent::Click provides `rect` with tray icon position/size and `position` with click coords
  - Use PhysicalPosition for window.set_position()
  - Window config properties: decorations, resizable, visible, skipTaskbar, alwaysOnTop
  - Note: TrayIconEvent may not fire on all Linux desktop environments
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-006
- What was implemented:
  - Popover closes when it loses focus (clicking outside)
  - Added WindowEvent::Focused handler in handle_run_event
  - When focused becomes false, window is hidden automatically
- Files changed:
  - Modified: src-tauri/src/tray.rs (added Focused event handling in match block)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - WindowEvent::Focused(bool) fires when window gains/loses focus
  - Use match block to handle multiple WindowEvent variants cleanly
  - Focus loss is triggered by clicking outside or switching to another window
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-007
- What was implemented:
  - Created PluginGrid component that renders plugins from registry as cards
  - Each card displays plugin icon (emoji) and name
  - Grid uses 3 columns with consistent spacing
  - Added shadcn Card component for styling
  - Created placeholder plugin to test the grid
  - Shows friendly message when no plugins available
  - Updated App.tsx to render PluginGrid as main content
- Files changed:
  - Created: src/core/components/PluginGrid.tsx (grid component)
  - Created: src/components/ui/card.tsx (shadcn Card component)
  - Created: src/plugins/placeholder/index.tsx (test plugin)
  - Modified: src/plugins/registry.ts (added placeholder plugin)
  - Modified: src/App.tsx (replaced demo content with PluginGrid)
  - Deleted: src/core/components/.gitkeep (no longer needed)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `bunx shadcn@latest add card --yes` to add shadcn components non-interactively
  - PluginGrid accepts onPluginClick prop for navigation (to be used in US-010)
  - Card hover effect: `hover:bg-accent` provides good visual feedback
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-008
- What was implemented:
  - Added WindowType type for window variants ('popover' | 'overlay' | 'window')
  - Added PluginCapabilities interface with optional fields: canCreateWindow, requiresOverlay, nativeFeatures
  - Extended PluginManifest interface with optional capabilities field
  - All types properly exported from src/core/types.ts
- Files changed:
  - Modified: src/core/types.ts (added WindowType, PluginCapabilities, extended PluginManifest)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep capabilities optional to maintain backward compatibility with existing plugins
  - nativeFeatures is a string array to allow flexible feature declarations
  - This prepares the architecture for advanced plugins without requiring changes to existing plugins
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-009
- What was implemented:
  - Verified that registry already exists with all required functionality
  - Registry was created in US-007 when implementing the PluginGrid
  - All acceptance criteria already met:
    - src/plugins/registry.ts exports typed PluginManifest array
    - Array contains placeholder plugin (satisfies "empty or with placeholder")
    - Import/export properly typed with TypeScript
    - Typecheck passes
- Files changed:
  - None (already implemented)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Check if previous user stories already implemented required functionality
  - US-007 (PluginGrid) implicitly created the registry with a placeholder plugin
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-010
- What was implemented:
  - Navigation from grid to plugin view using React useState
  - App.tsx manages activePlugin state (PluginManifest | null)
  - When activePlugin is set, renders the plugin's component
  - When null, shows the PluginGrid
  - PluginGrid already had onPluginClick prop ready (from US-007)
- Files changed:
  - Modified: src/App.tsx (added navigation state and conditional rendering)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Simple navigation can be done with useState in App.tsx - no need for context
  - Rendering dynamic component: `<activePlugin.component />` works when component is stored as ComponentType
  - US-007 was forward-thinking: PluginGrid's onPluginClick prop anticipated this navigation need
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-011
- What was implemented:
  - Created PluginHeader component with back button (←) and plugin name
  - Header displayed when inside a plugin view
  - Back button returns to the plugin grid using setActivePlugin(null)
  - Plugin content wrapped in scrollable container (flex-1 overflow-auto)
- Files changed:
  - Created: src/core/components/PluginHeader.tsx (header with back button)
  - Modified: src/App.tsx (added PluginHeader when activePlugin is set)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - shadcn Button size="icon-sm" is perfect for icon-only buttons in headers
  - Using variant="ghost" provides subtle hover feedback without heavy visuals
  - Wrap plugin content in overflow-auto container to handle plugins with scrollable content
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-012
- What was implemented:
  - Created src-tauri/src/storage.rs module with read/write commands
  - read_plugin_data(plugin_id) returns JSON string or null if file doesn't exist
  - write_plugin_data(plugin_id, data) saves JSON to ~/.local/share/jubby/{plugin_id}.json
  - Directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist
  - Removed unused greet command from lib.rs
  - Registered storage commands in invoke_handler
- Files changed:
  - Created: src-tauri/src/storage.rs (storage module with IPC commands)
  - Modified: src-tauri/src/lib.rs (added storage module, registered commands)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use std::env::var("HOME") to get home directory in Rust
  - PathBuf::join() is chainable for building paths
  - fs::read_to_string().ok() returns Option<String> - perfect for nullable returns
  - fs::create_dir_all() creates all parent directories as needed
  - Tauri commands return Result<T, String> for error handling
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-013
- What was implemented:
  - Created usePluginStorage<T>(pluginId, defaultValue) hook in src/core/hooks/
  - Hook returns { data, setData, isLoading }
  - Loads data from Rust storage on mount using invoke('read_plugin_data')
  - setData accepts value or updater function (like useState)
  - Automatically saves to Rust storage when setData is called
  - Uses @tauri-apps/api/core for Tauri IPC invocations
- Files changed:
  - Created: src/core/hooks/usePluginStorage.ts (the hook implementation)
  - Deleted: src/core/hooks/.gitkeep (no longer needed)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tauri v2 uses `import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/core'` (not '@tauri-apps/api')
  - invoke<T>() is generic - can specify expected return type
  - Rust snake_case command names are used as-is in invoke (read_plugin_data, not readPluginData)
  - Command parameters use camelCase in JavaScript (pluginId matches Rust plugin_id)
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-014
- What was implemented:
  - Created src/plugins/todo/ folder with plugin structure
  - Created types.ts with Todo interface (id, text, completed, createdAt) and TodoStorage interface
  - Created index.tsx with TodoManifest and placeholder TodoApp component
  - Registered TodoManifest in src/plugins/registry.ts (first in array to show first in grid)
- Files changed:
  - Created: src/plugins/todo/types.ts (Todo and TodoStorage interfaces)
  - Created: src/plugins/todo/index.tsx (TodoManifest and TodoApp component)
  - Modified: src/plugins/registry.ts (imported and added TodoManifest)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow existing plugin pattern: types.ts for interfaces, index.tsx for manifest + component
  - Use timestamp (number) for createdAt to enable easy sorting
  - Plugin order in registry.ts array determines grid display order
---

## 2026-01-12 - US-015
- What was implemented:
  - TodoApp now renders list of todos from usePluginStorage hook
  - Todos sorted by createdAt descending (most recent first)
  - Each todo displays checkbox and text
  - Completed todos have line-through and muted text styling
  - Empty state shows friendly message "No tasks yet. Add your first task!"
  - Loading state while fetching data from storage
  - Added shadcn Checkbox component for todo items
- Files changed:
  - Modified: src/plugins/todo/index.tsx (implemented TodoApp and TodoItem components)
  - Created: src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx (shadcn Checkbox component)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `bunx shadcn@latest add <component> --yes` for non-interactive shadcn installs
  - Sort with `.sort((a, b) => b.createdAt - a.createdAt)` for most recent first
  - disabled prop on Checkbox prevents interaction (useful for read-only state until US-017)
